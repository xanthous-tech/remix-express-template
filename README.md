# Remix + Express Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for building web applications with [Remix](https://remix.run) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

## Overview

I plan to add the following:

- [x] Express.js
- [x] Remix + Vite
- [x] TypeScript
- [x] tRPC
- [ ] DrizzleORM
- [ ] BullMQ
- [ ] Minio
- [ ] TailwindCSS
- [ ] Radix UI Theme
- [ ] shadcn/ui
- [ ] Auth (via Lucia or remix-auth)
- [x] BiomeJS
- [x] tsup

This covers all I need for building an app with a web frontend and an API backend.
